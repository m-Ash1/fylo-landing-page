## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid

### What I learned

I Learned how to build a whole project from scratch not just a simple landing page. also I learnt how to divide page into several sections and give every section padding to seperate every section from another to fit the page at the end at any screen

### Continued development

I will be more consistent and clear while naming the classes and sections. It makes a little bit confusion when I work on bigger projects.

### Useful resources

- [Color Picker Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorpick-eyedropper/ohcpnigalekghcmgcdcenkpelffpdolg) - This helped me to pick colors not in the style guide and I use this extension a lot in several projects.
- [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/) - This is an amazing website/game and helped me a lot to understand the concept of flexbox and practice on it with a funny story game.
